COVID-19 is a virus that has taken over the world for the last 19 months. It is a virus that causes some kind of respiratory distress. The best way to protect oneself from contracting the virus is by staying away from crowded places, washing your hands or at least sanitizing them.\r\nBelgium is a country in Western Europe. It is a country with a population of 11.59 million.It has a temperate kind of climate. Making the people here less susceptible to the virus as it thrives in colder weather. French, Dutch and German are the three most commonly languages in the country. Currently, the Federal Government exercises federal executive power.\r\nData Description\r\nThe first data set is from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. This is data set has 67 variables and provides necessary information about COVID around the globe. After filtering for Belgium I have picked out variables of my choice. Namely : date, new cases, new tests, new vaccinations and new deaths. For Belgium data was available from February 2020 till August 2021. Here the date variable is in date format while the rest are in double format or indicating numbers.\r\nNumerical Statistics and what they say:\r\nThe numerical Summary statistics very correctly indicate the initial surge of COVID in Belgium between February and May 2020. Then started rising again in August, reaching an all time high in early October which has seemed to be on the decline only form earlier this year. I am showing the mean which is the average of the numbers, in each of the categories and standard deviation which shows the deviation from the mean.\r\nThe summary statics also show us how many vaccine shots were administered since it became available in December last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"data\":[[2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021,2021],[\"Feb\",\"Feb\",\"Feb\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Mar\",\"Mar\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"Apr\",\"Apr\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\"May\",\"May\",\"May\",\"Jun\",\"Jun\",\"Jun\",\"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Jul\",\"Jul\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Aug\",\"Aug\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Sep\",\"Sep\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Oct\",\"Oct\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Nov\",\"Nov\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\",\"Dec\",\"Dec\",\"Dec\",\"Jan\",\"Jan\",\"Jan\",\"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Feb\",\"Feb\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Mar\",\"Mar\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"Apr\",\"Apr\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\"May\",\"May\",\"May\",\"Jun\",\"Jun\",\"Jun\",\"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Jul\",\"Jul\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Aug\",\"Aug\",\"Aug\"],[\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\",\"cases\",\"deaths\",\"tests\",\"vaccinations\"],[0.04,0,0,0,412.06,22.74,2230.71,0,1191.47,229.63,11269.43,0,318.13,60.42,15914.19,0,101.53,9.33,12456.27,0,236.26,3.03,14020.74,0,531.77,1.74,19439.61,0,1107.2,4.03,32828.63,0,10025.06,51.9,55613.32,0,4937.2,167.33,30416.37,0,2230.68,93,33352,17.81,2053.45,50.45,42923.55,11015.74,2191.36,35.18,42935.57,18842.68,3578.77,30.29,56756.1,36054.29,3592.53,40.47,45173,65660.27,2315.23,23.39,46428.39,93827.16,771,7.27,43579.23,138689.37,1276.9,2.19,63048.61,115899.45,1899.79,4.25,41907.46,50739.04],[0.2,0,0,0,509.7,40.84,1610.31,0,419.14,96.26,5593.13,0,136.12,55.01,5482.12,0,48.27,7.02,3335.39,0,203.03,2.77,5219.22,0,187.1,22.43,5525.87,0,562.58,3.44,9778.54,0,6266.98,46.89,16520.43,0,3372.04,54.48,10918.04,0,1016.95,33.34,11987.72,90.26,710.93,13.49,15737.04,9743.66,678.36,10.51,13378.46,12045.83,1881.67,17.09,18156.1,24241.25,1098.13,7.72,13215.84,37401.05,937.14,9.87,16065.78,47979.25,485.7,4.77,12581.72,51822.77,1219.22,2.52,15652.78,44674.11,1538.93,4.61,17642.66,36140.19]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>Year<\\/th>\\n      <th>Month<\\/th>\\n      <th>variables<\\/th>\\n      <th>mean<\\/th>\\n      <th>sd<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"pageLength\":8,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,3,4]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"lengthMenu\":[8,10,25,50,100]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\r\nHow did big brother help?\r\nBig brother is a famous term coined in the book 1984 by George Orwell. He used to indicate how digital technology is being used to track the world’s every move. But in a pandemic this could actually be used for the right reasons.\r\nFor instance, every persons location is being tracked using their cellular device. So the same anonymised insights used in Google maps was helpful in making critical decisions to combat the virus.\r\nThis data, shows how visits to places like, grocery stores and parks have changed when compared to a baseline. A baseline is the median value for the corresponding day of the week.\r\nIt has this information for 135 countries and even a state wise break up for some. This data was not used for medical diagnostic or prognostic purposes. It can help set working hours more effectively to avoid over crowding, set the requirement, timing and frequency of the transport at transit stations. This also help understanding the destination of the travelers and provide guidance to protect public health and needs of essential commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: Percentage of mobility from baseline\r\n\r\n\r\nS.no\r\n\r\n\r\nyear\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth\r\n\r\n\r\nretail_rec_\r\n\r\n\r\ngrocery_pharma\r\n\r\n\r\nparks\r\n\r\n\r\ntransit_stations\r\n\r\n\r\nwork\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nFeb\r\n\r\n\r\n-0.07\r\n\r\n\r\n0.00\r\n\r\n\r\n2.87\r\n\r\n\r\n-1.73\r\n\r\n\r\n-7.33\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nMar\r\n\r\n\r\n-42.10\r\n\r\n\r\n-8.97\r\n\r\n\r\n-10.16\r\n\r\n\r\n-36.61\r\n\r\n\r\n-31.03\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nApr\r\n\r\n\r\n-73.00\r\n\r\n\r\n-26.27\r\n\r\n\r\n-17.80\r\n\r\n\r\n-65.43\r\n\r\n\r\n-58.13\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nMay\r\n\r\n\r\n-49.06\r\n\r\n\r\n-13.68\r\n\r\n\r\n12.97\r\n\r\n\r\n-45.84\r\n\r\n\r\n-39.16\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nJun\r\n\r\n\r\n-17.70\r\n\r\n\r\n-5.03\r\n\r\n\r\n42.57\r\n\r\n\r\n-28.63\r\n\r\n\r\n-24.63\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nJul\r\n\r\n\r\n-9.94\r\n\r\n\r\n-7.77\r\n\r\n\r\n99.52\r\n\r\n\r\n-26.81\r\n\r\n\r\n-32.84\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nAug\r\n\r\n\r\n-12.84\r\n\r\n\r\n-8.58\r\n\r\n\r\n85.32\r\n\r\n\r\n-30.68\r\n\r\n\r\n-29.61\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nSep\r\n\r\n\r\n-11.20\r\n\r\n\r\n-4.97\r\n\r\n\r\n62.60\r\n\r\n\r\n-15.80\r\n\r\n\r\n-19.73\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nOct\r\n\r\n\r\n-26.29\r\n\r\n\r\n-3.55\r\n\r\n\r\n9.19\r\n\r\n\r\n-23.84\r\n\r\n\r\n-18.87\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nNov\r\n\r\n\r\n-53.60\r\n\r\n\r\n-11.07\r\n\r\n\r\n20.70\r\n\r\n\r\n-43.67\r\n\r\n\r\n-35.77\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nDec\r\n\r\n\r\n-37.84\r\n\r\n\r\n0.42\r\n\r\n\r\n-0.42\r\n\r\n\r\n-40.03\r\n\r\n\r\n-35.35\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\n2021\r\n\r\n\r\nJan\r\n\r\n\r\n-46.58\r\n\r\n\r\n-10.77\r\n\r\n\r\n-7.90\r\n\r\n\r\n-39.68\r\n\r\n\r\n-26.23\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\r\n2021\r\n\r\n\r\nFeb\r\n\r\n\r\n-38.61\r\n\r\n\r\n-0.50\r\n\r\n\r\n24.11\r\n\r\n\r\n-33.86\r\n\r\n\r\n-26.32\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\r\n2021\r\n\r\n\r\nMar\r\n\r\n\r\n-35.23\r\n\r\n\r\n4.52\r\n\r\n\r\n31.94\r\n\r\n\r\n-30.58\r\n\r\n\r\n-21.39\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\r\n2021\r\n\r\n\r\nApr\r\n\r\n\r\n-36.33\r\n\r\n\r\n8.33\r\n\r\n\r\n57.00\r\n\r\n\r\n-32.70\r\n\r\n\r\n-28.17\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\r\n2021\r\n\r\n\r\nMay\r\n\r\n\r\n-17.06\r\n\r\n\r\n12.81\r\n\r\n\r\n63.26\r\n\r\n\r\n-19.06\r\n\r\n\r\n-17.87\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\r\n2021\r\n\r\n\r\nJun\r\n\r\n\r\n1.73\r\n\r\n\r\n19.87\r\n\r\n\r\n81.33\r\n\r\n\r\n-10.77\r\n\r\n\r\n-10.23\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\r\n2021\r\n\r\n\r\nJul\r\n\r\n\r\n3.06\r\n\r\n\r\n12.42\r\n\r\n\r\n93.10\r\n\r\n\r\n-19.26\r\n\r\n\r\n-29.71\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\r\n2021\r\n\r\n\r\nAug\r\n\r\n\r\n5.52\r\n\r\n\r\n13.36\r\n\r\n\r\n105.28\r\n\r\n\r\n-18.00\r\n\r\n\r\n-26.20\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this it is obvious that the population staying at home and away form the work place has increased. Similarly transit stations (bus, metro and train stations) have also seen a large drop in people visiting them.\r\nRetail stores and recreational areas initially saw a huge drop and then around June last year has seen more movement. Then again from the resurgence in October last year it saw a drop in population with it increasing again in last couple of months.\r\nPharmacies however saw the least impact of a lock down. For obvious reason they had seen a more influx of movement compared to any other category of places considered barring Parks.\r\nParks however, in the minds of people, is indicated as an open space with enough area for social distancing and hence saw the maximum movement over the last 19 months.\r\nFrom this data it can be understood, while a good portion of the population stayed at home and away from places of work, there was still a certain amount of restricted movement in the country.\r\nConclusion:\r\nBelgium has seen a record number of deaths despite it’s population. Using the above tables we can find out that even during the months where the cases were very high like April and October 2020 the flux of mobility among the populaiton was still quite high with more then 20% of the population not following the restrictions at any place during the pandemic.\r\nCitations:\r\nPackages Used:\r\nGarrett Grolemund, Hadley Wickham (2011).

It is a virus that causes some kind of respiratory distress. The best way to protect oneself from contracting the virus is by staying away from crowded places, washing your hands or at least sanitizing them.\r\nJapan is an island nation that in East Asia. It is one of the most literate and technically advanced nations. This blog takes a look at different events and how it affected the biggest sporting event.\r\nOlympics during a pandemic and its effects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 28th Summer Olympics games was held in Tokyo, Japan. It was an event that was supposed to happen in July 2020. Because of the pandemic and toll it took on people worldwide was so magnanimous that the biggest sporting event was postponed to July 2020. The plots below show how the different pieces to the virus changed between the two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plot explains how Covid tests, cases and deaths have increased this year compared to last year. Vaccinations though have started only early this year thereby, not having showing anything for 2020. Even if the cases are on the rise, the fact that vaccinations are increasing at a higher rate is a positive sign for Japan.\r\nSince a major part in the rise in cases is happening in 2021, is it related to the Olympics? Did the huge influx in athelets, volunteers, coaches, doctors et al. cause this rise? This is also a big question Japanese journalists are trying to address.\r\nSince the games were supposed to be conducted last year, there have been personnel at the games village prepping for the actual event for over a year. The cases within persons involved in the games are higher this year than last for obvious reasons.\r\nThe maximum cases were for the Contractors with almost 150 cases. They had the most chances for mobility within the country explainig the highest numbers.\r\nFollowed by athletes, coaches, physiotherapists, umpires and other such persons. This could also be because of travelling from various countries. This however is puzzling because in both months the same number of people have been affected.\r\nWith volunteers and media persons also having a few cases. Somehow, the employees hired to set up the games were the least affected. But there were more cases in the latter part of the games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the larger picture, an event where more than 12,000 people were involved, there was just a little more than 500 cases (4%), which is proof that events can happen amidst a pandemic. The rise in cases in Tokyo might not be entirely related to the Olympics because the a majority of the people involved are now overseas in their home countries.\r\nFatalities on the road and in the lungs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapan is the longest - lived country. This was identified international comparison of recent mortality statistics. Making heart diseases and other major health issues a non-issue. But there are the two inevitable forms of fatalities, pandemics and road accidents. This part of the blog compares the number of deaths cause by accidents and covid. The first plot, simply shows the trend of how many fatalities happens for every occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Causes of death\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese donut charts are talking about the the proportion of deaths in comparison to road accidents and Covid. In 2020, when the cases were still low, it can be observed that the ratio of cause of death is almost similar. But in 2021, with the cases on the rise, the ratio has completely changed. This is also evident because, as cases rise people will stay at home causing fewer people to be about on the road.\r\nBut if lock down is taken out the picture for just a moment, that change in ratio over a year is surprising.\r\nBibliography\r\nPackages\r\nData\r\nRitchie, H., Mathieu, E., Rodés-Guirao, L., Appel, C., Giattino, C., Ortiz-Ospina, E., Hasell, J., Macdonald, B., Beltekian, D. and Roser, M., 2021.
